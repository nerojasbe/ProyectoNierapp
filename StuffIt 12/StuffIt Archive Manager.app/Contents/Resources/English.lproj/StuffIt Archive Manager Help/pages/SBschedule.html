Remember, that if you choose to have the backup task run at a timewhen you will not be present at your computer (such as late at night, or over theweekend) you will need to make sure that the destination you specified will beavailable at that time, and you must also ensure that it has enough free spacein which to save your archive. Using an external hard drive or a remote serveras a backup destination is the best way to do this.<br><br>Even if you are able to choose a backup destination that will enable you to schedulea backup in the middle of the night, make sure you remember to leave your computerrunning! StuffIt Scheduler cannot run a scheduled backup task if your computer hasbeen turned off gone to "sleep". <br><br><a href="SBsummary.html">Next</a><br><a href="SBusing.html">Back to Using StuffIt Scheduler</a><br><br><a href="../index.html">Back to Help Home Page</a><br><br><small>Copyright &copy; 2007 Smith Micro Software, Inc.
