It provides the best available compression technology, in addition to which it also includes a number of important features that help to keep your information safe and secure. <h3>Key StuffIt X Technologies</h3>The StuffIt X file formation includes a number of unique features that places it head and shoulders above Zip and other compression and archive technologies.<ul>	<li><b>Better Compression:</b> The StuffIt X file format includes all the latest advances in the science of file compression. Where as Zip only includes a single compression method, StuffIt X includes not only a range of compression algorithms, but also includes technology that can automatically pick the most appropriate method for the type of data being compressed. StuffIt X also supports block mode compression, meaning that the files you compress are automatically sorted into like groups and compressed together for maximum efficiency.</li>	<li><b>JPEG Compression:</b> The most recent advance in StuffIt compression technology is a new, patent pending, technology that allows StuffIt to further compress JPEG images as they are added to an archive, without further reducing image quality. StuffIt provides a 20 to 30% size reduction, on top of JPEG, without requiring a further compromise of image quality.</li>	<li><b>Error Recovery:</b> The StuffIt X file format includes built in technology that allows corrupted archives to be automatically repaired; not only is StuffIt able to recover information from damaged archives, it is actually able to repair the damage so that no data is lost. StuffIt's Error Recovery feature represents a huge step in protecting your files </li>	<li><b>Strong Encryption:</b> The StuffIt X file format was designed from the ground up to include strong encryption. StuffIt X supports RC4, AES, DES, and Blowfish encryption methods, and supports keys up to 512bits in length. While some Zip products have recently added strong encryption, its important for customers to understand that these implementations do not represent an industry standard; Zip archives that have been created with strong encryption using WinZip or PK Zip cannot be opened by standard Zip implementation, such as the ones included with Windows XP and Mac OS X, despite the fact that the files continue to carry the standard ".zip" file extension.</li>	<li><b>Built for Tomorrow's Data Compression Needs:</b> The StuffIt X file format includes a number of forward looking features that anticipate the changing requirements that users have for their archive software. The StuffIt X file format was designed from the ground up to support archives larger that 4Gb in size, and they also support more than 65,565 files in a single archive. While some Zip solutions also offer solutions for these limitations in the standard Zip format, it is important for customers to understand that by using such solutions they are making archives that do not conform to the established Zip standard. For example, if you use WinZip to create a Zip archive that is large that 4Gbs in size, that archive cannot be opened in the Zip implementations that ship as part of Windows XP and Mac OS X. The issues of trust that arise from archives that use the ".zip" extension, yet do not conform to the established standard for the Zip format, must be troubling for any user looking to archive information in what they believed to be an open and compatible standard.</li></ul><h3>StuffIt X Technical Details</h3>The <a href="AMadvanced.html">Expert Compression Settings</a> page has more technical details that will help you to configure the StuffIt X format and get the most from its advanced features.<br><br><a href="AMusing.html">Back to Using Archive Manager</a><br><br>		<a href="../index.html">Back to Help Home Page</a><br><br><br><small>Copyright &copy; 2007 Smith Micro Software, Inc.
