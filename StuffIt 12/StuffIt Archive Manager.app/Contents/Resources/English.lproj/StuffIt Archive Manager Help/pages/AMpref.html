The choices are StuffIt X and Zip.</li>	<li><b>Default Archive Name: </b>Determines the default name StuffIt will use when creating a new archive. 	<br><br>Note: You can rename the archive when choosing a save location.</li>	<li><b>Convert older StuffIt archives to StuffIt X on open: </b>This preference causes StuffIt to convert StuffIt 3 and 1.5.1 archives to StuffIt X format when you try to open them. These older StuffIt archive types, created by version of StuffIt that pre-date version 5 of StuffIt Deluxe, cannot otherwise be opened for browsing. This setting does not effect .sit archives created with version 5 or later of StuffIt Deluxe.</li></ul><h3>Compression</h3>The Compression page contains settings that relate to how Archive Manager creates archives. The Compression page contains a multi-tabbed group box that contains settings that are specific to particular file formats, and also contains items that are applied to all file formats.<br><br><b>Global Settings</b>The following settings apply to the creation of all archive formats:<ul>	<li><b>Don't compress files that are already compressed: </b>File types that are known to already include compression (such as GIF images, or QuickTime movies) will not be compressed when they are added to an archive. Selecting this option will save time where these types of files are involved. You may wish to deselect this option if you want Archive Manager to attempt to further compress these files. In most cases these files will not significantly decrease in size enough to warrant the time spent to compress them.</li><li><b>Ignore Finder Desktop Files: </b>When this option is set, Archive Manager will not add invisible Finder files (such as Desktop Database files from Classic Mac OS or .DS_Store files from OS X) to an archive.</li></ul><b>The StuffIt Tab</b><ul>	<li><b>Compression level: </b>As well as changing the format in which the archive will be created, you can also change the compression level that will be used when items are added to the archive. You can choose "Better Compression", "Faster Compression" or "No Compression"; as the names suggest the Faster compression method makes archives more quickly, the Better compression method creates smaller archives and the No Compression option groups files together into an archive without compression. An additional choice, Custom is also available. When Custom is selected you can use the <a href="AMadvanced.html#SITX">StuffIt X Expert Compression Settings</a> dialogto configure how Magic Menu and StuffIt CM will compress your files.</li>	<li><b>Segment Size: </b>The Segment Size pop-up menu can be used to select one of several common pre-defined segment size choices. These pre-set options are designed to cover a range of popular backup media such as Zip disks, and CD ROMS.</li>	<li><b>Encrypt archives with passphrase: </b>When this option is checked, the archives you create will be encrypted with a passphrase. You will be prompted to provide a passphrase before the compression begins. When you create an archive with encryption, be sure to make a careful note of your passphrase. Smith Micro Systems cannot recover files from encrypted archives if you have lost your passphrase. Passphrases are case sensitive.</li>	<li><b>Create Index Archives: </b> Creates a proxy "Index" archive at the same time a StuffIt X archive is created.<br><center><a href="indexarchives.html">Click here for more information on Index Archives.</a></center><br></li>	<li><b>Create Backwards Compatible Archives:</b> When this option is checked StuffIt X Archives will be created using only compression methods compatible with version 7.0 of StuffIt Expander for Macintosh.<br><center><a href="AMfaqs.html#EXP">Click here for more information about Recommended Expander Versions</a></center><br></li></ul><a ID="RECOMP"><center><b>Recompression</b></center></a>StuffIt 12 includes a new feature for making files even smaller. Like the JPEG compression we introduced in 2005, these recompressors make files smaller by 'disassembling' the structure of the data type and compressing it more efficienly using the StuffIt X format's own compressors. When the item is expanded from the StuffIt X archive, the structure for that particular data type is reassembled. <br><br>Generally this results in output that is identical to the original, but in some instances the output may not be 100% identical. The content itself, and any ancillary data is never lost - just the bit encoding changes sometimes.<br><br>A good example is Zip recompression. There are many compression attributes that can be used to create a Zip archive. When recompressing a Zip into a SITx archive, the Zip is opened and its content is compressed into the SITx archive. Upon expansion, the Zip archive is recreated. The recreated Zip archive and the original Zip archive may have different compression attributes and are therefore not identical, but if each of the Zips is expanded the resulting output will be identical. This example also applies to image formats that contain compressed information as part of the structure. This is commonly referred to as "pixel-perfect". Identical output is commonly referred to as "bit-perfect". <br><br>StuffIt 12 includes custom recompressors for these file formats:<ul><li>JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg) - Always bit-perfect</li><li>JPEG lossless (.jls) - pixel-perfect</li><li>JPEG 2000 (.j2k) - pixel-perfect <br>    <b>Note - recompression is only applied when a j2k file is lossless encoded</b></li><li>Bitmap (.bmp) - Always bit-perfect</li><li>GIF (.gif) - pixel-perfect</li><li>TIFF (.tif, .tiff) - depends on data</li><li>PSD (.psd) - depends on data</li><li>PNG (.png) - pixel-perfect</li><li>PICT (.pict, .pct) - pixel-perfect</li><li>PXM (.pbm, .pgm, .ppm) - Always bit-perfect</li><li>MP3 (.mp3) - Always bit-perfect</li> <li>Zip (.zip, .cbz) - pixel-perfect</li><li>PDF (.pdf) - depends on data</li></ul><p>Check each type for which you wish to enable recompression. By default, the JPEG and Zip recompressors are enabled. The JPEG compressor has an additional option: Include Thumbnails. When this option is enabled, a small thumbnail of the image is stored in the archive for quick previewing.</p><b>The Zip Tab</b><ul><li><b>Compression level: </b>As well as changing the format in which the archive will be created, you can also change the compression level that will be used when items are added to the archive. The choices are "Faster Compression" and "Better Compression". As the names suggest, the Faster Compression method makes archives more quickly, and the Better Compression method creates smaller archives. An additional choice, Custom is also available. When Custom is selected you can use the <a href="AMadvanced.html">Expert Compression Settings dialog</a> to determine how Archive Manager will compress your files.</li>	<li><b>Encrypt Archives With Passphrase: </b>When this option is checked, the archives you create will be encrypted with a passphrase. You will be prompted to provide a passphrase before the compression begins. <br><br>Note: When you create an archive with encryption, be sure to make a careful note of your passphrase. We cannot recover files from encrypted archives if you have lost your passphrase. <br><br> Note2: Passphrases are case sensitive.<li><b>Preserve Macintosh Content: </b>This option determines whether or not Macintosh specific file attributes (such as a resource fork and Finder information) is preserved when adding files to Zip archives. Typically, if you are sending files to a Windows user you do not need to preserve this information, as it will not be used on a Windows-based computer. If you are sending files to a Macintosh user, we would recommend that you preserve Macintosh file information by sending your files in an archive format designed for the Macintosh, such as StuffIt X. <br><br><b>If you do need to send Macintosh files to other Macintosh users in Zip format, checking this option will preserve Macintosh file information in a way that is compatible with Apple's Zip implementation used in the Finder in Mac OS X 10.3 and later, but other options such as encryption may not be compatible with Apple's Zip implementation. Also note that Zip archives using Apple's method of preserving resource forks are not compatibile with pre-9.x versions of StuffIt Expander for Macintosh.</b></li></ul><h3>Expansion</h3>The Expansion Preferences are used to determine how Archive Manager goes about the task of expanding an archive or encoded file.	<ul>	<li><b>Scan for Viruses: </b>Archive Manager allows you to automatically scan files that are extracted from archives and encoded files for viruses with your virus protection software. Archive Manager supports Virex, Norton AntiVirus, and Virus Barrier. If you would like to try using a different anti-virus program, choose "Other..." from the pop-up menu.</li><li><b>Set execute permissions by default: </b>This preference determines whether Archive Manager should set the UNIX execute file permission on items expanded from archives that do not store UNIX file permissions. If you un-check this box, OS X applications expanded from such archives may not run correctly.</li>	</ul><a href="AMadvanced.html">See also Expert Compression Settings.</a> <br><br>		<a href="../index.html">Back to Help Home Page</a><br><br><br><small>Copyright &copy; 2007 Smith Micro Software, Inc.
