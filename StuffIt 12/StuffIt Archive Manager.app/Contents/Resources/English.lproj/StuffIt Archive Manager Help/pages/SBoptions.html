This option is on by default.<br><br>Check the "Verify the archive..." box to have StuffIt Scheduler verify thatthe backup archive was created successfully. This option is on by default.<br><br>Check the "Perform this task with administrative privileges" box if you wish to backup files belonging to users other than yourself. This option may also be helpful for eliminating <b>some</b> of the "File permissions errors" that you may see listed in the right pane of the "Logs" window for a particular task. This option is off by default.<br> <br>StuffIt Scheduler also allows you to create your backup archive with encryption. Choose the compression method you want to use, and specify the archive that will be used to encrypt the archive. This password will be used everytime the task you are creating is run. <br><br><a href="SBstarted.html">Back to Getting Started</a> <br> <br> <a href="../index.html">Back to Help Home Page</a><br><br><br><br><small>Copyright &copy; 2007 Smith Micro Software, Inc.
