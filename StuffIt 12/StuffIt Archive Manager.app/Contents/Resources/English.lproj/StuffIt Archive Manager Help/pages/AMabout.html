Archive Manager enables you to selectively extract only the files you want from a much larger archive.<br>		<br>		Archive Manager also allows you to work with most StuffIt and Zip in much the same way as you would work with files and folders in the Finder; using Archive Manager you can add, remove, rename, move, copy, and delete files, as well as create new folders to better organize the data in your archives.<br>		<br>		Previously a separate application called Archive Assistant, in StuffIt 12, Archive Manager now has the ability to schedule archive creation. <a href="SBusing.html">Click here to find out more about using StuffIt Scheduler.</a><br>		<br>		Archive Manager also includes powerful tools to help you work with and manage the archives you create. Much like Smart Playlists in iTunes and Smart Albums in iPhoto, Archive Manager allows you to create custom <a href="AMcollections.html">Collections</a> of archives that allow you to view all of the data associated with a particular project with a single click. Collections are controlled by a set of search criteria that you define. Archive Manager's Collections are tightly integrated with Apple's Spotlight search technology to provide fast and optimized searches that are automatically updated.<br>		<br>		Some examples:</font>		<ul>			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Create a Collection that contains just the StuffIt archives in your Documents folder that have been either created or changed within the last week.</font>			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Create a Collection that contains any archives located in your Downloads folder.</font>		</ul>		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Archive Manager Collections can collect more than just archives! An Archive Manager Collection can contain any type of file. Using this feature, you can use Archive Manager as a project manager application to keep track of all the files and folders associated with a particular task and easily archive them.<br>		<br>		<a href="../index.html">Back to Help Home Page</a><br>		<br>		<br>		</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial" size="1">Copyright &copy; 2007 Smith Micro Software, Inc.
