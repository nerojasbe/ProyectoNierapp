For most users, this is the most desirable option. In some cases, you may only want to include certain files from the selected folder in the backup archive. The "Custom Criteria" dialog provides a way to tell StuffIt Scheduler exactly what files should be included or excluded from the backup archive. <br><br>The criteria dialog works in the same way as the Finder's "Find..." function. By adding search criteria in this dialog, you can tell StuffIt Scheduler to search the folder you have selected to find matching items to backup. <br><br>This feature is especially useful for backup tasks that are designed to run on a regular basis, for example once a week. You can use the "Date Modified" command in the "Custom Criteria" dialog to tell StuffIt Scheduler to only add files that have changed in the last week to your latest backup archive. Using this approach, you will create smaller backup archives that contain only those files that have changed, rather than creating much larger archives that contain the same unchanged files week after week. <br><br><a href="SBdest.html">Next</a><br><a href="SBusing.html">Back to Using StuffIt Scheduler</a><br><br><a href="../index.html">Back to Help Home Page</a><br><br><small>Copyright &copy; 2007 Smith Micro Software, Inc.
