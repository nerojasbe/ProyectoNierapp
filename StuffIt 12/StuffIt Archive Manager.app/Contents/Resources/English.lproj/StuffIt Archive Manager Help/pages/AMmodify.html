The easiest way to add content to an archive is to drag & drop the files and folders you want to add from a Finder window into the archive window. Any items you drag & drop into the Archive Manager window will be compressed and added to the archive. The original files remain uncompressed in the Finder.<br><br>Note: Certain types of Zip archive cannot be modified. If you use any StuffIt Deluxe component to create a Zip archive, and the "Preserve Macintosh Content" preference is checked in the Zip page of the preferences dialog, you will not be able to modify the contents of that archive after it has been created. Zip archives created in the Finder using Apple's Zip implementation are also locked as read only.<br><br>Note: Self-Extracting StuffIt 5 archives (.sea) files can be browsed and modified using StuffIt Archive Manager. Where-as SEA files for Mac OS Classic automatically expand their contents when they are double clicked on computers running Classic versions of the Mac OS, these archives will be opened in StuffIt Archive Manager when you open them on a computer on which StuffIt Deluxe 12 has been installed.<h3>Using Archive Manager Collections to create an Archive</h3>Archive Manager includes the ability to create custom Collections of files and folders. These smart <a href="AMcollections.html">Collections</a> function much like saved searches. Clicking a Collection in the Archive Manager interface causes Archive Manager to list all files and folders that match the search criteria that were specified when the Collection was first created. <br><br>To create an archive from items listed in a collection:<ol>	<li>Launch the StuffIt Archive Manager application</li>	<li>Click on a Collection listed in the left hand column of the main Archive Manager window. <a href="AMcollections.html">Click here for more on creating Collections.</a> Archive Manager will now begin to build a list of the items that match the search criteria specified in the selected collection.</li>	<li>Select one or more of the items listed when you click the Collection</li>	<li>Right-click (or Control-click) the items you selected and choose "New Archive from Selection" from the Contextual Menu that appears.</li>	<li>When prompted to do so, choose a name and save location for your new archive. By default, Archive Manager will create a StuffIt archive. You can change the archive format using the "Archive Type" pop-up menu.</li>	</ol>	<h3>Modifying the Contents of an Archives</h3>Archive Manager gives you the ability to modify the contents of StuffIt and Zip archives. The first step involved in modifying an archive is to open it. You can open archives in one of three ways:<ul>	<li>Drag & Drop the archive you want to open onto the StuffIt Archive Manager icon.</li>	<li>Choose "Open" from the File menu and then navigate to and select the archive you want to open.</li>	<li>Find and double-click the archive you want to open using Archive Manager's <a href="AMcollections.html">Collections</a> interface.</li>	</ul><h4>Adding New Empty Folders</h4>To add a new empty folder to an archive, click the "New Folder" button on the Archive Window toolbar, or Right-click (or Control-click) in the empty space of the archive windows and select "New Folder" from the Contextual Menu.<br><br>In addition to adding files to a StuffIt archive, you can also rename, copy, and move or delete items that are stored in an archive.<h4>Renaming Files within an Archive</h4>To rename an item, double-click the item, or select the item then hit the Enter key.<h4>Copying Files within an Archive</h4>To copy a file within an archive, drag & drop while holding down the Option key. Again, this works just like copying files in the Finder.<h4>Moving Files within an Archive</h4>To move a file, select the item you want to move, and drag & drop it to a new location in the archive such as a sub-folder.<h4>Deleting Files from an Archive</h4>To delete a file, select the item you want to delete, then click the Delete button in the Archive Window toolbar, or "Delete" from the Archive menu.<br><br>Some archives you open will be marked as "read-only" as indicated by a an icon in the lower right of the Archive Window. This means that their contents cannot be changed. Any archive located on a read-only volume (i.e.: a CD or DVD), any archive with the "Locked" attribute set in the Finder Get Info window, or any archive for which you have read-only privileges can be browsed, but not modified. Also, StuffIt X archives created by Archive Assistant, StuffIt X archive created with "Error Correction" enabled, and encrypted StuffIt X archives created with StuffIt 9.x for Macintosh - are examples of StuffIt X archives that are read-only.<br><br><a href="AMusing.html">Back to Using Archive Manager</a><br><br>		<a href="../index.html">Back to Help Home Page</a><br><br><br><small>Copyright &copy; 2007 Smith Micro Software, Inc.
