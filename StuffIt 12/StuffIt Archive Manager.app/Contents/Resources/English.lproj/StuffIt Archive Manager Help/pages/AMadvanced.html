It works by replacing a series of bytes with a reference to a previous occurrence of the same series of bytes. Method 1 is also used when the compression level is set to "Faster".</li><li><b>Best Binary Compression (Method 2): </b>Method 2 is optimized for the compression of binary files (such as applications) and also for fast decompression. Method 2 works in the same way as Method 1, except that it has a more exact way of representing the offsets and lengths, which makes it compress a little more, but at the cost of slower compression and decompression. Typically Method 2 will provide you with the best results when you're compressing applications.</li><li><b>Best Size/Speed Trade Off (Method 8): </b>Method 8 provides the best trade-off between compression/decompression speed and archive file size and works well on a variety of different file types. This compression method does a reversible sort on the data, which places like data closer together which makes it more compressible.<br><br>Note: This method replaces Method 3 and archives created with this compression method must be opened with StuffIt Expander 9.02 or later on the Macintosh, or StuffIt Expander 9.0 or later on Windows.</li><li><b>Best Text Compression (Method 4): </b>Method 4 provides compression that is primarily optimized for text. This compression method works by "predicting" what the next byte will be based on previous data. For example, if it is predicting the byte following "t" and "h", it will give high probabilities to "e", and "a".</li><li><b>Choose by File Type (Method 5, aka "Mix"): </b>This compression method uses a combination of the "Best Text Compression" method and the "Best Size Speed Trade Off" method to achieve better results. If the file being compressed is a mostly text file, it uses Method 4, otherwise it uses Method 8. As Method 8 (see above) can potentially be used in the creation of archives, StuffIt Expander 9.02 on the Macintosh, and Expander 9.02 on Windows will be required to open these files.</li></ul><h3>Levels and Extents </h3> Levels and Extents are variables used to optimize performance (i.e.: compression speed vs. expansion speed vs. compressed size) for a particular set of data.<br><br><b>Levels: </b>Levels generally set "how hard" each method tries to compress. In the matching algorithms (Method 1 &amp; 2 [Fastest Compression &amp; Best Binary Compression]), levels 1-9 generally correspond to gzip's compression levels. The higher the number the harder it tries to find a match (more compression, but slower). Levels above 9 use a different, more exhaustive search for previous matches, which gets extra compression, but at the expense of speed. In the "prediction" algorithm, the level corresponds to how many previous bytes to use when making the prediction. Note: Not all the compression methods used by StuffIt X support setting compression levels. You cannot specify compression levels for Methods 8 or 6 [Best Size/Speed Trade Off or Choose Method by Analysis].<br><br><b>Extents: </b> Extents has a direct relationship to how much memory is used. In Methods 1 &amp; 2 [Fastest Compression &amp; Best Binary Compression], the extent sets how far back to look for a match. In Method 4 [Best Text Compression], extent sets how much memory to use for storing the prediction information.<h3>Encryption Method</h3> StuffIt X archives can be created with encryption. There are 4 compression methods supported: <ul><li>	<b>1=RC4</b> - Supports up to 512bit key lengths. </li><li>	<b>2=DES</b> - Supports to 64bit key lengths</li><li>	<b>3=BlowFish</b> - Supports up to 448bit key lengths</li><li>	<b>4=AES</b> - Supports up to 256bit key lengths</li></ul><h3>Error Correction</h3> StuffIt X archives can be created with Error Correction. Adding error correction code to an archive will increase its size, but its availability allows the StuffIt Engine to reconstruct data damaged as the result of bad media or transfer errors during the decode phase. You can vary the amount of error correction code applied to an archive during the encode phase. The more error correction you add, the larger the archive will become. But more error correction also adds the ability to repair larger disasters. It is, of course, possible to have large enough damage that even error correction will not be able to save the entire contents of the archive. The range of values supported are as follows: <ul><li>	1/128 of a block (1% Overhead) </li><li>	1/64 of a block (3% Overhead) </li><li>	1/32 of a block (6% Overhead) </li><li>	1/16 of a block (14% Overhead) </li><li>	1/8 of a block (33% Overhead) </li></ul></li><h3>Text Encoding</h3> StuffIt X archives can be converted to ASCII text format. Three text encoding methods are available, Base 64 (-L 1), Base 85 (-L 2) and Base 222 (-L 3). The levels of available text encoding determine how much of the full ACSII character set will be used to encode the data. The more characters used, the less size overhead will be imposed as a result of translating the binary data of the archive into text characters. When sending archives via E-mail, it is best to use Base-64. This uses the fewest characters, but as a result is the most compatible. Base 222 is a good choice if files are being posted to a news group.<h3>Optimizers</h3> Optimizers are special compression methods designed to handle specific file types. StuffIt includes optimizers designed to compress Wave sound files (.wav), TIFF graphics (.tif, .tiff), and text files (.txt).<h3>Block Mode</h3> The Block Mode setting determines whether StuffIt will group like files together in order to compress them more efficiently. This allows the compressor to benefit from a longer history, and to benefit from redundancy that may occur across multiple files. <br><br>Depending on the data set, Block Mode can provide a marked improvement in compression rations, and is generally at least as fast as compressing files indivdually.<hr><a id="ZIP"></a><h3>Zip Expert Compression Settings</h3><h3>Zip Compression Method</h3>When creating Zip (.zip) archives you can choose between the following compression methods: "Deflate" and "Deflate 64". Deflate is the default that all Zip-compatible applications use. Not all third-party Zip tools support Deflate 64. If you are going to share Zip files with others, you should use the Deflate option. You can also choose to use "No compression" when creating Zip archives. <h3>Setting the Compression Level</h3> You can set the compression level for Zip compression between 1 and 15. At level 1 compression will be very fast, but the archives will be larger. At level 15 compression will be very slow, but the archives will be very small. Changing the compression level has no effect on the compatibility of the archive with other zip-capable programs.<br><br><a href="AMpref.html">Back to Preferences</a> <br><br><small>Copyright &copy; 2007 Smith Micro Software, Inc.
