This functionality is now provided by way of a Spotlight plugin. When StuffIt Deluxe is installed, Spotlight is able to extend its indexing capabilities to include the names of all the files located within StuffIt, Zip, and Tar archives. When you use Spotlight to run a search, if a matching file is located within an archive, that archive is returned as part of Spotlight's search results.<br><br>Note: Encrypted archives are excluded from Spotlight's indexing.<br><br><a href="AMusing.html">Back to Using Archive Manager</a><br><br>		<a href="../index.html">Back to Help Home Page</a><br><br><br><small>Copyright &copy; 2007 Smith Micro Software, Inc.
