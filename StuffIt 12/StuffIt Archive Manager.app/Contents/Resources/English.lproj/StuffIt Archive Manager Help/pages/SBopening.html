As you create and schedule backup tasks, they'll show up in this list.You'll be able to see when the task was last run, and when it is scheduled torun again. You can also edit the details of the tasks from this dialog, butmore about that later. To get started creating your first backup task, clickthe "New Task" button on the StuffIt Scheduler toolbar.<br><br><a href="SBstarted.html">Next</a><br><a href="SBusing.html">Back to Using StuffIt Scheduler</a><br><br><a href="../index.html">Back to Help Home Page</a><br><br><small>Copyright &copy; 2007 Smith Micro Software, Inc.
