This wizard style interface will walk you step by step throughthe process of selecting what to backup, where to create the backup archive, and whenthe backup task should be run. The first dialog, however, simply asks you to pick aname for the backup task you are about to create. The options button allows you toset some <a href="SBoptions.html">advanced options</a>, but we recommend that youleave those alone for right now. When you've picked a name, click the "Continue"button to move to the next step. You can also use the Cancel button to exit theassistant, or the Help (question mark) button to access information specific to the page you areon at any step in this process.<br><br><a href="SBwhat.html">Next</a><br><a href="SBusing.html">Back to Using StuffIt Scheduler</a><br><br><a href="../index.html">Back to Help Home Page</a><br><br><small>Copyright &copy; 2007 Smith Micro Software, Inc.
