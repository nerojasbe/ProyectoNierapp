StuffIthas a great solution to this problem, and will automatically break your backuparchive into pieces small enough to fit on your media. StuffIt will alsoautomatically reassemble these pieces if you ever need to restore from your backup. Do remember, however, if you are backing up to CD you will need to be near the computer to insert additional CD's (or DVD's) as and when they are needed.<h3>Using External Hard Drives</h3>Perhaps the most convenient option is to backup to an external hard drive, suchas a Firewire hard drive. If you choose this option, you can schedule your backup to occur late at night or over the weekend when you don't need to use your computer. You can tell StuffIt which drive your want to backup to simply by dragging and dropping your drive's icon into the indicated window. <h3>Using FTP</h3>If you backup to an FTP server, you'll need to know the exact URL to the folder on the FTP server you want to backup to, and you'll also likely need to provide a username and password to log on. Ask the person who administers the FTP server if you need to get this information.<h3>Backing up to your iDisk</h3>If you computer is configured to use your .Mac account, you can upload your backup archive directly to your iDisk. No additional configuration is necessary. Be aware, however, that the amount of storage space available on your iDisk is limited, typically to 100mb. You can find the backup archive you create in the "Documents" folder on your iDisk.<h3>Using a Date and Time Stamp</h3>When you create a backup archive with StuffIt Scheduler, you can choose to adda date and time stamp to the end of the archive name when it is created. Thisis useful if you anticipate storing several archives created from the same taskin a single location. The date and time stamp uses the following formatyyyymmdd-hhmmss; the year is listed first, then the month, then the day, thenthe hours, minutes and seconds.<br><br><ol><i><b>Note:</b></i> If you do not use the date and time stamp, StuffIt Scheduler will automatically overwrite older backup archives that have the same name, created from the same task that already exist in the specified destination. In this case, previous backups will be lost. If you are using a Custom Criteria filter this means that previously backed up items, not meeting the Custom Criteria you specified, will be lost.</ol><br><br><a href="SBschedule.html">Next</a><br><a href="SBusing.html">Back to Using StuffIt Scheduler</a><br><br><a href="../index.html">Back to Help Home Page</a><br><br><small>Copyright &copy; 2007 Smith Micro Software, Inc.
