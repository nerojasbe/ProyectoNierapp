<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN""http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Wilbur/HTML32.dtd"><html><head><title>Archive Manager Help: StuffIt Scheduler</title></head><body><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"><h3>Working with Tasks</h3>When you exit the wizard you should now see the backup job you just created listed.There are various ways in which you can work with the backup task you have just created. <br><br>You can see when your backup task was last run by looking at the value in the "Last Run"column. You can see the date when the backup task is due to run next by looking in the"Next Scheduled Run" column.<br><br>You can choose to run a backup task at any time by selecting it from the list of tasksand clicking the "Run Task" button on the toolbar. Clicking the "Run Task" button willnot alter the schedule that was previously  assigned to the task.<br><br>You can edit the details of a previously  created backup task by double-clicking a task in the list or by selecting a task from the list and clicking the "Edit Task" button on the toolbar. Rather than using an assistant interface, you can edit the details of your task in a tabbed dialog. This will allow you to jump directly to the page you want to edit, without having to click throughthe ones you want to leave alone. Each tab in the dialog corresponds to the page in the assistant we used to create the backup task. <br><br>You can remove a task from the list by selecting it and clicking the "Delete" button.<br><br><a href="SBusing.html">Back to Using StuffIt Scheduler</a><br><br><a href="../index.html">Back to Help Home Page</a><br><br><small>Copyright &copy; 2007 Smith Micro Software, Inc.
