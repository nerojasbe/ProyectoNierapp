Archive Manager allows you to organize your archives into smart Collections that are dynamically updated as you create and download additional files.<br><br>By default, Archive Manager comes with a number of pre-defined Collections; with a single click you can quickly view all archives of a particular format. Click on the "Zip Archives" Collection, for example, and you are quickly presented with a list of all the Zip archives available both on your computer and on any mounted network drive. Powered by Apple's Spotlight search technology, Archive Manager's Collections are continually updated as the contents of your hard drive change. <br><br><b><i>Tip:</b> You can easily open the Finder folder containing an item in search result list by selecting it and clicking the "Reveal" button at the bottom-right of Archive manager's Main Window.</i><br><br>Archive Manager also allows you to filter your Collection results using the "Search" field included at the top of the window. Simply type all or part of the name of the file you're looking for, and Archive Manager will filter the list. By default it will filter its list to include only those results that "Contain" your filter. You can click on the Magnifying Glass icon to change the setting to "Matches" so that it will only show those results with names that match exactly.<br><br>Note: "Matches" looks at the entire file name including the file extension.<h3>Previews</h3>Archive Manager's Main Window includes a "Preview" pane, this slide out drawer allows you to view thumbails of any JPEGs stored in your StuffIt archive without first requiring you to expand or open that archive. If you select an archive from the list and open the "Preview" drawer, StuffIt will begin to search through the contents of your archive looking for pictures to display. <br><br>Note: Only StuffIt X archives created with JPEG Compression and one of the thumbnail options enabled contain JPEG previews.</li>	 	  <h3>Creating Custom Archive Collections</h3>In addition to the pre-defined Collections that ship with Archive Manager, you can also create your own custom Collections. These custom Collections work in much the same way as "Smart Playlists" in iTunes. To create a custom collection you start by defining a set of search criteria (such as the archive type, size, or modification list) and then when Archive Manager displays your collection it searches the Spotlight database for all accessible archives and displays only those items that match the search criteria you specify.<br><br>Here's how to create a custom archive Collection that contains StuffIt X archives modified with in the last week:<ol>	<li>Launch the Archive Manager application</li>	<li>Click the "+" button in the lower left corner of the application to create a new custom Collection.</li>	<li>In the drop down sheet that results, define the search criteria you want to to use to create your Collection.</li>	<li>In the "Description" field enter text that will help to remind you of what this Collection is designed to do. For this example, type "New StuffIt X Archives"	<li>The "Search Location" section allows you to specify where Archive Manager will look for matching archives. Choose "Computer" to search on all hard drives accessible to your computer. This will include your hard drive, any external hard drives you have attached, as well as any mounted network drives.</li>	<li>In the "Search For" section, specify the type of item you are looking for. In this example, click the "Name" pop-up menu and choose "Kind". In the pop-up menu that appears to the right of the "Name" field, choose "Archives", and in the next pop-up menu choose "StuffIt X".</li>	<li>To add an additional search parameter click the "+" button.</li>	<li>Click the "Name" pop-up menu and choose "Last Modified" to create criteria that will display archives that have been recently modified. Type "7" in the text entry field to display only items that have been modified within the last seven days.</li>	<li>Click "OK" to close the dialog. You should notice that the Archive Manager dialog now has a new listing for the Collection you just created. Once you exit the dialog Archive Manager will immediately start building the list of archives that match your search terms.</li>	</ol>You can edit a Collection by double-clicking its name in the Archive Manager Main Window. <br><br>Note: You cannot edit the pre-defined archive Collections that come with Archive Manager. <br><br>You can remove a custom Collection by selecting its name in the Archive Manager dialog and clicking the "-" button.<h3>Beyond Archive Collections</h3>So far this discussion has covered how you would go about using Archive Manager to create Collections of archives; this is the primary purpose for which the application was designed. But Archive Manager is able to create Collections that contain <b>ANY</b> type of file, including applications, music, and pictures! Using Archive Manager you can create a Collection that includes all the files you need to work on a particular project.<br><br>For example if (to pick a random example) you were the technical writer for StuffIt Deluxe 11 you could create a Collection that contains only files located in the "Documents" folder that contain "StuffIt" in the name. <br><br>Here's how:<ol>	<li>Launch the StuffIt Archive Manager application</li>	<li>Click the "+" button in the lower left corner of the application to create a new custom Collection.</li>	<li>In the drop down sheet that appears, define the search criteria you want to to use to create your Collection.</li>	<li>In the "Description" field enter text that will help to remind you of what this Collection is intended to do. For this example, type "StuffIt Deluxe 11 Help Files"</li>	<li>In the "Search Location" area click "Others"</li>	<li>Click the new "+" button to add a new location to the "Others" list.	<li>Use the Mac OS X Folder Selection dialog to choose the Documents folder.	<br><br>	<b><i>Tip:</b> You can also drag folders from the Finder to this window.</i>	<br><br></li>	<li>In the "Name" field type "StuffIt"</li>		<li>Click "OK" to close the dialog. You should notice that the Archive Manager dialog now has a new listing for the Collection you just created. Once you exit the dialog Archive Manager will immediately start building the list of archives that match your search terms.</li></ol><b><i>Tip:</b> Collection search criteria is exclusive. If you search for files, Kind: GIF, and add a second criteria Kind: JPG, no items will be returned as a file can't be both a GIF and JPG. You can still get the combined search results by creating two different Collections, one with the GIF criteria, and one with the JPG criteria. Then select both Collections in the Archive Manager main window and results for both searches will be returned.</i>	<br><br><!--------not enabled---------->Once you have a list of items displayed in the Archive Manager you can open any of the items by double-clicking it. <!--------not enabled---------->You can also choose to archive one, many, or all of the files in the list using the contextual menu that appears when you Right-click (or Control-click) on a selection of items from the list.<h3>Status and Progress</h3>At any time you can determine what Archive Manager is doing by using the Status Bar and the Progress Window. The Status Bar displays the following information:<ul>	<li>How many items are currently selected</li>	<li>How many total items are included in the current Collection</li>	<li>How many items are currently being displayed (in cases where the current Collection is narrowed using the "Search" dialog.)</li>	<li>The activity cursor indicates whether StuffIt has finished generating the list of items in the current Collection.</li>	</ul>The Progress Window shows the progress of tasks such as searching for JPEG preview data, compressing, and expanding files.<h3>Archive Manager and Spotlight</h3>Archive Manager utilizes Apple's Spotlight Search technology. Accordingly, any items that exist in locations you have excluded from Spotlight searches will not be displayed. To view a list of excluded locations, do the following:<ol>	<li>From the Apple Menu, choose "System Preferences"</li>	<li>Click the "Spotlight" button</li>	<li>Click "Privacy" </li></ol>Spotlight will only search locations to which you have read access. By default, if you are using a regular Mac OS X account with Administrator privileges you do not have read access to accounts owned by other users of your computer. As such, Archive Manager will display items stored in your "Documents" folder (for example) but will not list items located in the "Documents" folder of other users of your computer.<br><br>Typically, Spotlight searches utilize a cached database to provide very fast performance. Archive Manager, which is integrated with Spotlight, also benefits from this. There are, however, some exceptions. If a volume you have mounted is marked as Read Only Spotlight is not able to cache search data, and therefore searches have to be conducted in real time. This has the result of slowing down Spotlight, which in turn slows down Archive Manager. One scenario that can cause large Read Only volumes to be accessible to your computer is if you have used Boot Camp to create a Windows volume, and chose to format that volume using the NTFS file system (the default choice in the Windows XP install process). These NTFS volumes can be searched by Spotlight, and Archive Manager is able to display file located on these volumes, but the fact that the volume can't be written to from within Mac OS X means that no search data can be saved. As a result, Spotlight and StuffIt have to search these volumes from scratch every time you request a search.<br><br>On rare occasions you may find that Archive Manager does not list a file in a Collection even though the file matches the criteria you have specified and is located in a location Spotlight should to have indexed. When this problem occurs, you can often resolve it by forcing Spotlight to rebuild its search index for the location in question. To do this:<ol>	<li>From the Apple Menu, choose "System Preferences"</li>	<li>Click the "Spotlight" button</li>	<li>Click "Privacy" to view a list of excluded locations.</li>	<li>Drag the folder which contains the item not being listed to the exclusions list.</li>	<li>Close the "Privacy dialog</li>	<li>Re-open the Spotlight Privacy dialog and remove the item you just added. This should force Spotlight to re-index the folder.</l1></ol>	<b><i>Tip:</b> If you want to completely rebuild your Spotlight databases, drag all of your volumes to the "Privacy" list, then remove them. Spotlight will immediately begin to re-index all of your files.Be patient, this may take a long time.</i><br><br>By default Spotlight includes items in the Trash when creating an index of your home folder. If you would like to prevent Spotlight from doing this, you can exempt the Trash folder using these steps:<ol>	<li>From the Apple Menu, choose "System Preferences"</li>	<li>Click the "Spotlight" button</li>	<li>Click "Privacy" to view a list of excluded locations.</li>	<li>Click the "+" button to bring up the dialog to browse for the folder to exempt. As Trash is an invisible folder, you cannot simply browse to its location using this dialog.</li>	<li>Click the forward slash key "/" to bring up a dialog into which you can enter a path. In the resulting dialog type the following location (without the quotes): "~/.Trash".</li>	<li>The Trash folder will now be opened. Click the "Choose" button to add the Trash folder to the exemptions list.</li>	</ol><a href="AMusing.html">Back to Using StuffIt Archive Manager</a><br><br>		<a href="../index.html">Back to Help Home Page</a><br><br><br><small>Copyright &copy; 2007 Smith Micro Software, Inc.
