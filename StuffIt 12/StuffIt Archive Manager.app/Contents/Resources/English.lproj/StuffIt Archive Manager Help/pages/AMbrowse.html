By default, when you double-click on one of these supported archive types in the Finder, Archive Manager will open and display the contents of that archive. You can also open an archive to browse its contents by dragging and dropping onto the Archive Manager icon.<br><br><b><i>Tip:</b> You can choose what happens when you double-click on an archive by using the "File Mapping" page in the StuffIt Expander preferences dialog. For each format that can be browsed by Archive Manager, you can choose to either assign to StuffIt Expander (meaning the archive will be immediately expanded when you double-click it) or assign to Archive Manager (meaning that the archive will be browsed when you double-click it.)</i><br><br>When you browse the contents of an archive in Archive Manager the folder structure of the archive is represented hierarchically. By default, the window in  will contain all the items located in root (or top level) folder of the archive. To view the contents of a top level folder, simply click the disclosure triangle next to its name. The contents of the folder will be displayed underneath the folder icon, indented slightly to the right. <h3>Extracting files from an archive</h3>In addition to browsing the contents of StuffIt, Zip, TAR, and RAR archives, the Archive Manager application allows you to extract individual files or folders, or a selection of files and folders, from the archive without having to expand the archive in its entirety.<br><br>To extract an item from an archive, use one of the following methods:<h4>Toolbar</h4><ol>	<li>Select the item you wish to extract</li>	<li>Click the "Extract" button in the archive window toolbar</li>	<li>Use the Mac OS X Folder Selection dialog to choose the folder to which the selected item should be extracted</li></ol><h4>Menu</h4><ol>	<li>Select the item you wish to extract</li>	<li>Select "Extract" from the "Archive" Menu</li> 	<li>Use the Mac OS X Folder Selection dialog to choose the folder to which the selected item should be extracted</li></ol><h4>Contextual Menu</h4><ol>	<li>Right-click (or Control-click) on the item you wish to extract</li>	<li>Select "Extract" from the Contextual Menu that appears</li>	<li>Use the Mac OS X Folder Selection dialog to choose the folder to which the selected item should be extracted</li></ol><h4>Drag & Drop</h4><ol>	<li>Select the item you wish to extract</li>	<li>Drag it to the destination folder or window in the Finder to which you would like that item expanded.</li></ol>Note: The four methods (Toolbar, Menu, Contextual Menu and Drag & Drop) are used throughout Archive Manager. Use whichever is most convenient for you.<h3>Archive Comments</h3>The Archive Manager application allows you to add comments to your StuffIt archives. You can use comments to note information about the contents of the archive, or to give directions to a recipent of the archive. When expanded, the comments will be saved as a separate text file.To add a comment to an archive, open in the Archive Manager application:<ol>	<li>Click the "Comment" button in the lower left corner of the archive window.</li>	<li>In the text entry field provided, add your comments.</li>	<li>Click "OK" to save the comment and close the comment window.</li>	</ol>In the Archive Window the Comment button will now show lines to indicate that there is a comment stored in this archive. To edit or delete a comment:<ol>	<li>Click the "Comment" button in the lower left corner of the archive window</li>	<li>Edit or delete the text in the comment field.</li>	<li>Click "OK" to save your changes and close the comment window.</li>	</ol></ol>Note: If the archive is Read-Only, or located on a Read-Only volume, you will not be able to add or modify an archive comment.<h3>Get Info</h3> If you want to view more information about an item in the archive, select the item and click the "Get Info" button from the Archive Manager toolbar. <br><br>In addition to basic information about the Name, Kind, Original and Compressed Size, Dates of Creation and Modification, and Label for the file, the Archive Manager Get Info window includes a number of advanced attributes that related to advanced features of the StuffIt file format:<ul>	<li><b>Original:</b> In StuffIt X archives, the Original attribute provides information about the original location of the file before it was added to an archive. StuffIt Expander can then use this information to "restore" the file back to its original location on the hard drive. This information is only recorded for each top level item in an archive. The location for lower level items is calculated based on that items relationship to its top level folder.	<br><br>	Archives created with Archive Assistant contain Original attributes.	</li>	<li><b>Preview:</b> StuffIt X archives created with JPEG Compression and one of the thumbnail options enabled contain JPEG previews. The Preview tab allows you to preview the thumbnail of the compressed image without having to expand it from the archive.</li>	 	 	<li><b>Comments:</b> Just as you can assign comments to the archive as a whole, Archive Manager also allows you to assign comments to individual files in the archive using the Comments field in the Get Info window.</li></ul><a href="AMusing.html">Back to Using Archive Manager</a><br><br>		<a href="../index.html">Back to Help Home Page</a><br><br><br><small>Copyright &copy; 2007 Smith Micro Software, Inc.
