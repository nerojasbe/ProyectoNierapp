When picking files to backup, the default option will simply backup all the files in your "Documents" folder. In Mac OS X most data that you have created while using your computer will be stored somewhere in your Home directory. The default interface that is presented in this dialog is designed to make it easy for you to add the various folders in your Home folder to the backup set. You can choose to add the entire Home folder to your backup set by checking the top item in the list. This will backup all the files in your Home folder, this includes not only you documents, but also any files on your desktop. This option will also backup your personal preferences and settings for the various applications you use.<br><br>StuffIt Scheduler allows you to add any folder on any accessible network or local drive to the list of items that will be archived. You can add items to the backup list simply by dragging and dropping them from the Finder to the StuffIt Scheduler window. You can also use the "+" button to browse for items to add to the list, or use the "-" button to remove optional items from the list.<br><br><a href="SBexempt.html">Next</a><br><a href="SBusing.html">Back to Using StuffIt Scheduler</a><br><br><a href="../index.html">Back to Help Home Page</a><br><br><small>Copyright &copy; 2007 Smith Micro Software, Inc.
