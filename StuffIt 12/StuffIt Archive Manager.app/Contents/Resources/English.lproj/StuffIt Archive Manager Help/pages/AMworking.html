 <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN"        "http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Wilbur/HTML32.dtd"><html><head>	<title>Working with Archive Collections</title> </head><body><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> <h3>Archive Collections</h3>StuffIt Archive Manager provides you with more than just a way to browse and modify the contents of your archives. Archive Manager allows you to organize your archives into smart collections that are dynamically updated as you create and download additional files.<br><br>By default, Archive Manager comes with a number of pre-defined collections; with a single click you can quickly view all archives of a particular format. Click on the "Zip" button, for example, and you are quickly presented with a list of all the zip archives available both on your computer and on any mounted network drive. Powered by Apple's Spotlight search technology, Archive Manager's collection are continually updated as the contents of your hard drive change. <br><br>StuffIt Archive Manager also allows you to search for items within your collection using the "Search" field included at the top of the window. Simply type all or part of the name of the file you're looking for, and Archive Manager will update its list to include only those archives that match the search terms you specify.<h3>Previews</h3>StuffIt Archive Manager includes a "Preview" pane, this slide out window allows you to view any pictures stored in your archive without first requiring you to expand or open that archive. If you select an archive from the list and click the "Preview" button, StuffIt will begin to search through the contents of your archive looking for pictures to display. StuffIt Archive Manager allows you preview JPEG, GIF, and TIFF images. <h3>Creating Custom Archive Collections</h3>In addition to the pre-defined collections that ship with Archive Manager, you can also create your own custom collections. These custom collections work in much the same way as "Smart Playlists" in iTunes. To create a custom collection you start by defining a set of search criteria (such as the archive type, size, or modification list) and then when Archive Manager displays your collection it searches its database of all accessible archives and displays only those items that match the search criteria you specify.<br><br>Here's how to create a custom archive collection that contains StuffIt X archives modified with in the last week:<ol>	<li>Launch the Archive Manager application</li>	<li>Click the "+" button in the lower left corner of the application to create a new custom collection.</li>	<li>In the drop down sheet that results, define the search criteria you want to to use to create your collection.</li>	<li>In the "Description" field enter text that will help to remind you of what this collection is designed to do. For this example, type "New StuffIt X Archives"	<li>The "Search Location" section allows you to specify where StuffIt Archive Manager will look for matching archives. Choose "Computer" to search on all hard drives accessible to your computer. This will include your hard drive, any external hard drives you have attached, as well as any mounted network drives.</li>	<li>In the "Search For" section, specify the type of item you are looking for. In this example, click the "Name" pop-up menu and choose "Kind". In the pop-up menu that appears to the right of the "Name" field, choose "Archives", and in the next pop-up menu choose "StuffIt X".</li>	<li>To add a additional search parameter click the "+" button.</li>	<li>Click the "Name" pop-up menu and choose "Last Modified" to create criteria that will display archives that have been recently modified. Type "7" in the text entry field to display only items that have been modified within the last seven days.</li>	<li>Click "OK" to close the dialog. You should notice that the Archive Manager dialog now has a new listing for the collection you just created. Once you exit the dialog Archive Manager will immediately start building the list of archives that match your search terms.</li>	</ol>You can edit a collection by double clicking it's name in the Archive Manager dialog. Note, you cannot edit the pre-defined collections that come with Archive Manager. <br><br>You can remove a custom collection by selecting its name in the Archive Manager dialog and clicking the "-" button.<h3>Beyond Archive Collections</h3>So far this discussion has covered how you would go about using Archive Manager to create collections of archives; this is the primary purpose for which the application was designed. In fact StuffIt Archive Manager is able to create collections that contain any type of file, including applications, music, and pictures. Using StuffIt Archive Manager you can create a collection that includes all the files you need to work on a particular project - for example if (to pick a random example) you were the technical writer for StuffIt Deluxe 11 you could create a collection that contains only files located in the "Documents" folder that contain "StuffIt" in the name. <br><br>Here's how you'd make this collection:<ol>	<li>Launch StuffIt Archive Manager</li>	<li>Click the "+" button in the lower left corner of the application to create a new custom collection.</li>	<li>In the drop down sheet that results, define the search criteria you want to to use to create your collection.</li>	<li>In the "Description" field enter text that will help to remind you of what this collection is designed to do. For this example, type "StuffIt Deluxe 11 Help Files"</li>	<li>In the "Search Location" area click "Others"</li>	<li>Click the new "+" button to add a new location to the "Others" list.	<li>Use the Mac OS X Folder Selection dialog to choose the Documents folder.</li>	<li>In the "Name" field type "StuffIt"</li>		<li>Click "OK" to close the dialog. You should notice that the Archive Manager dialog now has a new listing for the collection you just created. Once you exit the dialog Archive Manager will immediately start building the list of archives that match your search terms.</li></ol>Once you have a list of items displayed in the Archive Manager you can open any of the items by double clicking it. You can also choose to archive one, many, or all of the files in the list using the contextual menu that appears when you CTRL-Click on a selection of items from the list.<h3>Status and Progress</h3>At any time you can figure out what StuffIt Archive Manager is up to by using the status bar and the progress window. The Status Bar displays the following information:<ul>	<li>How many items are currently selected</li>	<li>How many total items are included in the current collection</li>	<li>How many items are currently being displayed (in cases where the current collection is narrowed using the "Search" dialog.)</li>	<li>The activity cursor indicates whether StuffIt has finished generating the list of items in the current collection.</li>	</ul>The Progress window display is used when StuffIt Archive Manager has to access the contents on an archive. A progress will be displayed, for example, when StuffIt is searching the contents of an archive for pictures to display in the "Preview" pane.<h3>StuffIt Archive Manager and Spotlight</h3>StuffIt Archive Manager utilizes Apple's Spotlight Search technology. Accordingly, any items that exist in locations you have excluded from Spotlight searches will not be displayed. To view the list of locations currently not being searched by Spotlight:<ol>	<li>From the Apple Menu, choose "System Preferences"</li>	<li>Click the "Spotlight" button</li>	<li>Click "Privacy" to view a list of excluded locations.</li></ol>Spotlight will only search locations to which you have read access. By default, if you are using a regular Mac OS X account with Administrator privileges you do not have read access to accounts owned by other users of your computer. As such, Archive Manager will display items stored in your "Documents" folder (for example) but will not list items located in the "Documents" folder of other users of your computer.<br><br>Typically, Spotlight searches utilize a cached database to provide very fast performance. StuffIt Archive Manager, which is integrated with Spotlight, also benefits from this. There are, however, some exceptions. If a volume you have mounted is marked as Read Only Spotlight is not able to cache search data, and therefore searches have to be conducted in real time. This has the result of slowing down Spotlight, which in turn slows down Archive Manager. One scenario that can cause large Read Only volumes to be accessible to your computer is if you have used Boot Camp to create a Windows volume, and chose to format that volume using the NTFS file system (the default choice in the Windows XP install process). These NTFS volumes can be searched by Spotlight, and Archive Manager is able to display file located on these volumes, but the fact that the volume can't be written to from within Mac OS X means that no search data can be saved. As a result, Spotlight and StuffIt have to search these volumes from scratch every time you request a search.<br><br>On rare occasions you may find that StuffIt Archive Manager does not list a file in a collection even though the file matches the criteria you have specified and is located in a location Spotlight ought to have indexed. When this problem occurs, you can often solve it by forcing Spotlight to rebuild it's search index for the location in question. To do this:<ol>	<li>From the Apple Menu, choose "System Preferences"</li>	<li>Click the "Spotlight" button</li>	<li>Click "Privacy" to view a list of excluded locations.</li>	<li>Drag the folder which contains the item not being listed to the exclusions list.</li>	<li>Close the "Privacy dialog</li>	<li>Re-open the Spotlight Privacy dialog and remove the item you just added. This should force Spotlight to re-index the folder.</l1></ol><a href="AMusing.html">Back to Using Archive Manager</a><br><br><a href="../index.html">Back to Help Home Page</a> <br><br><small>Copyright &copy; 2007 Smith Micro Software, Inc.
