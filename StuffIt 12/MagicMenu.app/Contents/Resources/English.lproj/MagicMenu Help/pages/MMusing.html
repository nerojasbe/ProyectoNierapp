It creates a special icon in the Finder's menu bar. To use MagicMenu to perform a task, select the items you want to process and click the menu bar icon to reveal a list of StuffIt related tasks that can be performed. The same list of commands that are displayed in the MagicMenu are also available from StuffIt's contextual menu. To access the contextual menu, hold down the Control (Ctrl) key while clicking a file. After you install StuffIt Deluxe, you should see a new "StuffIt" Menu appear in the contextual menu. <ol><i><b>Tip:</b> Invest in a two button mouse! When you use a two button mouse, right-clicking on a file will have the same effect as using the Control [CTRL] click combination.</i></ol>The MagicMenu and StuffIt Contextual Menu both allow you access to the following functions:<ul>	<li><b>Stuff: </b>By default, the Stuff command will create a StuffIt X archive that contains the items that are currently selected in the Finder.</li>	<li><b>Archive: </b>The archive menu provides you with the option to create archives from the items currently selected in the Finder, in a wide variety of formats. You can create StuffIt X, Zip, and TAR archives using the Archive command. Archives preserve hierarchical folder structure. You can also choose to further compress or encode these archives so that you end up with, for example, a Gzip compressed TAR archive.</li>	<li><b>Compress: </b>The Compress menu allows you to compress single files selected in the Finder using Gzip, Bzip2, and Unix Compress compression. Compression operations can only be performed on individual files, not folders or selections of multiple files.</li>	<li><b>Encode: </b>The Encode menu allows you to encode single files selected in the Finder using MacBinary, BinHex, AppleSingle, and UUEncode formats. Encoding operations can only be performed on individual files, not on folders. A folder must be compressed into a single file before it can be encoded.</li>	<li><b>Legacy: </b>The Legacy menu allows you to compress files into older and less common formats. </li>	<ul>	<li><b>Stuff (.sit): </b>This option creates archives in the older StuffIt 5 format.</li>	<li><b>Make Self-Extracting: </b>The Make Self-Extracting menu allows you to compress files into a StuffIt 5 (.sit) archive and make that archive self-extracting for either Classic Macintosh OS (.sea) or Windows (.exe).</li>	<li><b>LHa: </b>This option creates LHa archives.</li>	</ul>		<li><b>Segment: </b>Use the Segment menu option to divide large files into smaller pieces. The size of the segments that will be created can be set in the StuffIt Menu Preferences dialog.</li>	<li><b>Mail: </b>This is a very powerful feature. The Mail sub-menu allows you to create an archive and send it via E-mail in a single step. Just select the item(s) you want to send, go to the MagicMenu and choose (for example) "Stuff & Mail". The Mail sub-menu lists a variety of archiving and compression options so you can compress and mail an archive created in most of the formats that are supported by StuffIt. You can also choose "Mail" which allows you to send the selected item(s)Êwithout archiving.</li>	<li><b>Preferences: </b>Opens the StuffIt Menu Preferences dialog.</li></ul><ul><i><b>Note: </b>Archive Sizes: We always recommend using StuffIt X (.sitx) compression for better compression, better protection, and the capacity for very large archive sizes into the terabyte range. If you are creating archives in Zip (.zip) or the previous StuffIt format (.sit) please be aware that if the total size of the files you want to compress is at or near 2 GB and above, the resulting archive may not be usable and the data inside may be unrecoverable. You may attempt making larger archives in these older formats, but always test them to make sure they expand correctly and all the files are usable. As always, it is important to keep a backup copy of your files.</i></ul><h3>Conditional Menu Items</h3>Some of the items in the MagicMenu and StuffIt Contextual Menu are conditional and only appear when you select specific types of files. <br><br>When you select an already archived, compressed, or encoded file, and go to the MagicMenu or the StuffIt Contextual Menu, the following StuffIt sub-menu item appears:<ul>	<li><b>UnStuff: </b>This menu item causes the selected item to be expanded.</li></ul>When you select a browsable archive and go to the MagicMenu or the StuffIt Contextual Menu, the following StuffIt sub-menu item appears:<ul>	<li><b>Browse in Archive Manager: </b>This menu item causes the archive to be opened in the StuffIt Archive Manager application.</li></ul>When you select the first segment from a set of Stuffit segments (.sit1), the following option appears:<ul><li><b>Join: </b>This option will join the segments back into a single archive. You must have all the segments located in the same folder for this option to work successfully. If you have other types of segmented files such as StuffIt X, use the "UnStuff" option from the StuffIt Menu. StuffIt should automatically join the segments and expand the resulting file.</ul>When you select a compressed Tape Archive (TAR file), such as a .tgz file, the following option appears:<ul>	<li><b>Remove Compression: </b>This option allows you to convert a compressed Tape Archive into an uncompressed TAR file.</li></ul>When you select an encoded file, and go to the MagicMenu or the StuffIt Contextual Menu, the following StuffIt sub-menu item appears:<ul>	<li><b>Remove <encoding type> encoding: </b>This menu item causes the selected item to be decoded.</li></ul>When you select a Disk Image, and go to the MagicMenu or the StuffIt Contextual Menu, the following StuffIt sub-menu item appears:<ul>	<li><b>Mount: </b>This menu item causes the selected item to be mounted as a volume in the Finder.</li></ul><h3>Magic Menu</h3>The Magic Menu is a companion to the StuffIt Contextual Menu. It allows you to access StuffIt Contextual Menu functions from the Finder's Menu bar. Magic Menu works in the same way as the StuffIt Contextual Menu, and exactly the same range of functions are available. <br><br>Magic Menu will load whenever you log onto your computer. You can quit Magic Menu by selecting this option from the Magic Menu in the Finder. Even if you quit MagicMenu you will still have access to the StuffIt Contextual Menu.<br><br>When Magic Menu is loaded, you can also access StuffIt functions in the Finder using Command-key shortcuts. Use Command+S to stuff files and folders that have been selected in the Finder, and use Command+U to unstuff archives, compressed, and encoded files that have been selected in the Finder. <ol><i><b>Note:</b>You can also use Command+Option+1 to create StuffIt X archives, Command+Option+2 to create StuffIt 5 archives, and Command+Option+3 to create Zip archives.</i></ol><h3>Optionally Disable MagicMenu</h3>To prevent MagicMenu from loading when the system starts, follow these steps:<ol>	<li>From the Apple Menu, choose "System Preferences"</li>	<li>Click "Accounts" to open that control panel.</li>	<li>Click your users name in the Accounts control panel.</li>	<li>Click the "Login Items" tab.</li>	<li>Select the "MagicMenu" item from the list that appears.</li>	<li>Click the "-" button to remove MagicMenu. MagicMenu will now no longer launch when your computer starts up.</li></ol><h3>Growl</h3>If you have the notification system <a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a> installed on your machine, Magic Menu/StuffIt Contextual Menu will use it to display alerts and other messages.<br><br>		<a href="../index.html">Back to Help Home Page</a><br><br><br><small>Copyright &copy; 2007 Smith Micro Software, Inc.
