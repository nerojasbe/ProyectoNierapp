To open the Menu Preferences dialog, choose Preferences from the Magic Menu.<h3>Expansion Preferences</h3>The Expansion Preferences are used to determine how Magic Menu and StuffIt CM go about the task of expanding an archive or encoded file.	<ul>	<li><b>Continue to expand (if possible): </b>This preference, when enabled, causes Magic Menu and StuffIt CM to scan the file that results from expanding an archive, compressed, or encoded file to see if it can be further expanded. For example, when this preference is enabled, and Magic Menu and StuffIt CM encounters a BinHex encoded StuffIt archive, it will start to expand the archive as soon as it has decoded the BinHex layer. Archives, compressed, and encoded files contained within folders in the archive must be separately expanded.</li><li><b>Set execute permissions by default: </b>This preference determines whether Magic Menu and StuffIt CM should set the UNIX execute file permission on items expanded from archives that do not store UNIX file permissions. If you un-check this box, OS X applications expanded from such archives may not run correctly.</li>		<li><b>Delete after expanding: </b>The archives and compressed files you expand will be deleted once the files they contain are successfully extracted. <b>Use this preference with caution! If the archive or compressed file is damaged, or any error occurs during expansion, the file may still be deleted and would then have to be replaced before you can try expanding it again.</b></li>			<li><b>Scan for Viruses: </b>Magic Menu and StuffIt CM allow you to automatically scan files that are extracted from archives and encoded files for viruses with your virus protection software. Magic Menu and StuffIt CM support Symantec AntiVirus, VirusScan, and Virus Barrier. If you would like to try using a different anti-virus program, choose "Other..." from the pop-up menu.</li></ul><h3>Compression Preferences</h3>The Compression page contains settings that relate to how Magic Menu and StuffIt CM create archives. The Compression page contains a multi-tabbed group box that contains settings that are specific to particular file formats, and also contains items that are applied to all file formats.<br><br><b>General Items</b>The following settings apply to the creation of all archive formats:<ul>	<li><b>Mail using: </b>This pop-up menu allows you to select the mail client that will be used when using the Stuff and Mail command. All the mail clients that support the MagicMenu mail commands are listed in this pop-up menu.</li>		<li><b>Ignore Special Finder Files: </b>When this option is set, Magic Menu and StuffIt CM will not add Finder files (such as Desktop Database files or .DS_Store) to an archive.</li>	<li><b>Create Individual Archives: </b>When this option is set, compressing multiple items with StuffIt Menu will result in each item being compressed in its own individual archive.	</li></ul><b>The StuffIt Tab</b><ul>	<li><b>Compression level: </b>As well as changing the format in which the archive will be created, you can also change the compression level that will be used when items are added to the archive. You can choose "Better Compression", "Faster Compression" or "No Compression"; as the names suggest the Faster compression method makes archives more quickly, the Better compression method creates smaller archives and the No Compression option groups files together into an archive without compression. An additional choice, Custom is also available. When Custom is selected you can use the <a href="MMadvanced.html#SITX">StuffIt X Expert Compression Settings</a> dialogto configure how Magic Menu and StuffIt CM will compress your files.</li>	<li><b>Segment Size: </b>The Segment Size pop-up menu can be used to select one of several common pre-defined segment size choices. These pre-set options are designed to cover a range of popular backup media such as Zip disks, and CD ROMS.</li>	<li><b>Encrypt archives with passphrase: </b>When this option is checked, the archives you create will be encrypted with a passphrase. You will be prompted to provide a passphrase before the compression begins. When you create an archive with encryption, be sure to make a careful note of your passphrase. Smith Micro Systems cannot recover files from encrypted archives if you have lost your passphrase. Passphrases are case sensitive.</li>	<li><b>Create Index Archives: </b> Creates a proxy "Index" archive at the same time a StuffIt X archive is created.<br><center><a href="indexarchives.html">Click here for more information on Index Archives.</a></center><br></li>	<li><b>Create Backwards Compatible Archives:</b> When this option is checked StuffIt X Archives will be created using only compression methods compatible with version 7.0 of StuffIt Expander for Macintosh.<br><center><a href="MMfaqs.html#EXP">Click here for more information about Recommended Expander Versions</a></center><br></li></ul><a ID="RECOMP"><center><b>Recompression</b></center></a>StuffIt 12 includes a new feature for making files even smaller. Like the JPEG compression we introduced in 2005, these recompressors make files smaller by 'disassembling' the structure of the data type and compressing it more efficienly using the StuffIt X format's own compressors. When the item is expanded from the StuffIt X archive, the structure for that particular data type is reassembled. <br><br>Generally this results in output that is identical to the original, but in some instances the output may not be 100% identical. The content itself, and any ancillary data is never lost - just the bit encoding changes sometimes.<br><br>A good example is Zip recompression. There are many compression attributes that can be used to create a Zip archive. When recompressing a Zip into a SITx archive, the Zip is opened and its content is compressed into the SITx archive. Upon expansion, the Zip archive is recreated. The recreated Zip archive and the original Zip archive may have different compression attributes and are therefore not identical, but if each of the Zips is expanded the resulting output will be identical. This example also applies to image formats that contain compressed information as part of the structure. This is commonly referred to as "pixel-perfect". Identical output is commonly referred to as "bit-perfect". <br><br>StuffIt 12 includes custom recompressors for these file formats:<ul><li>JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg) - Always bit-perfect</li><li>JPEG lossless (.jls) - pixel-perfect</li><li>JPEG 2000 (.j2k) - pixel-perfect <br>    <b>Note - recompression is only applied when a j2k file is lossless encoded</b></li><li>Bitmap (.bmp) - Always bit-perfect</li><li>GIF (.gif) - pixel-perfect</li><li>TIFF (.tif, .tiff) - depends on data</li><li>PSD (.psd) - depends on data</li><li>PNG (.png) - pixel-perfect</li><li>PICT (.pict, .pct) - pixel-perfect</li><li>PXM (.pbm, .pgm, .ppm) - Always bit-perfect</li><li>MP3 (.mp3) - Always bit-perfect</li> <li>Zip (.zip, .cbz) - pixel-perfect</li><li>PDF (.pdf) - depends on data</li></ul><p>Check each type for which you wish to enable recompression. By default, the JPEG and Zip recompressors are enabled. The JPEG compressor has an additional option: Include Thumbnails. When this option is enabled, a small thumbnail of the image is stored in the archive for quick previewing.</p><b>The Zip Tab</b><ul><li><b>Compression level: </b>As well as changing the format in which the archive will be created, you can also change the compression level that will be used when items are added to the archive. The choices are Faster Compression and Better Compression; as the names suggest, the Faster Compression method makes archives more quickly, and the Better Compression method creates smaller archives. An additional choice, Custom is also available. When Custom is selected you can use the <a href="MMadvanced.html">Expert Compression Settings dialog</a> to determine how Magic Menu and StuffIt CM will compress your files.</li>	<li><b>Encrypt archives with passphrase: </b>When this option is checked, the archives you create will be encrypted with a passphrase. You will be prompted to provide a passphrase before the compression begins. When you create an archive with encryption, be sure to make a careful note of your passphrase. Smith Micro Systems cannot recover files from encrypted archives if you have lost your passphrase. Passphrases are case sensitive.	<li><b>Preserve Macintosh Content: </b>This option determines whether or not Macintosh specific file attributes (such as a resource fork and Finder information) is preserved when adding files to Zip and TAR archives. Typically, if you are sending files to a Windows user you do not have to preserve this information, as it will not be used on a Windows-based computer. If you are sending files to a Macintosh user, we would recommend that you preserve Macintosh file information by sending your files in a format designed for the Macintosh, such as StuffIt X or StuffIt 5. If you do need to send Macintosh files to other Macintosh users in Zip format, however, checking this option will preserve Macintosh file information in a way that is now compatible with the Zip implementation used in the Finder in Mac OS X 10.3 and later.</li></ul><b>The TAR tab</b><li><b>Compression Method: </b> TAR archives, by default, contain no compression. You can choose to further compress a TAR archive using either Gzip, Bzip2, or UNIX Compression. <li><b>Compression Level: </b>When you have selected a compression method to use in conjunction with TAR archives, you can then select a compression level to be used.</li><h3>Destination</h3>The Destination preferences allow you to specify where Magic Menu and StuffIt CM should create files. Use this dialog to:	<ul>	<li>Specify where newly created archives should be saved.</li>	<li>Specify where newly created segments should be saved.</li>	<li>Specify where Expanded files should be saved.</li></ul>The available choices are the same in all three cases. The following options are:<ul>	<li><b>Same as original: </b>When this option is selected files will be created in the same folder as the source file(s)</li>	<li><b>Ask: </b>When this option is selected, Magic Menu and StuffIt CM will prompt you to specify a location in which files should be created.</li>	<li><b>Use specified: </b>Use this option to specify a location to be used every time Magic Menu and StuffIt CM saves a file.</li></ul>You can also specify whether or not Magic Menu and StuffIt CM should place expanded files into a new surrounding folder.	<ul>	<li><b>When the archive contains multiple items: </b>When this option is selected, Magic Menu and StuffIt CM will create a surrounding folder whenever the archive contains multiple items at the root level. The name of the archive will be used for the newly created folder.</li>	<li><b>Never: </b>Magic Menu and StuffIt CM will never create a surrounding folder.</li>	<li><b>Always: </b>Magic Menu and StuffIt CM will always create a surrounding folder.</li></ul><h3>Return Receipt</h3>Magic Menu and StuffIt CM allow you to add Return Receipt requests to your StuffIt 5 (.sit) archives. A Return Receipt request is used to ask the person receiving your file to let you know that they were able to expand the contents successfully. A Return Receipt Request includes your name, email address, and a message to your recipient. Return Receipt requests cannot be added to StuffIt X (.sitx) archives.<br> <br> The StuffIt Menu Preferences dialog allows you to pre-configure a Return Receipt request so that it can quickly be added to an archive. In the fields provided enter your Name, Email Address, and a message to be displayed to the user when they open the archive.<h3>Menu Options</h3>Allows each of the items in the Magic Menu and StuffIt CM to be turned on and off. You can also choose to turn off the StuffIt Finder keyboard shortcuts by unchecking the box for MagicMenu Command Keys. <br><br>		<a href="../index.html">Back to Help Home Page</a><br><br><br><small>Copyright &copy; 2007 Smith Micro Software, Inc.
