Can you help me? <br><br><b>A:</b> No. In the case of StuffIt archives, StuffIt uses very secure encryption algorithms. We have no method to access the contents of an encrypted archive without the encryption password. <br><br><br> <b>Q:</b> When I download files from the internet, my web browser doesn't launch StuffIt Expander to open them. <br><br><b>A:</b> In many cases StuffIt Expander will be used automatically by your Web browser to expand files immediately after they are downloaded, but you can also expand files by dragging and dropping either onto the StuffIt Expander icon or into the "Drag Window" that appears when you launch StuffIt Expander. This kind of manual expansion is needed when your Web browser fails to call upon StuffIt Expander, or when the file comes as an email attachment or other non-Web source. <br><br>If your Web browser does not use StuffIt Expander for an automatic expansion of a file you downloaded, this has to do with the configuration of your Web browser. Questions about this should be directed to the manufacturer of the browser. The good news is that StuffIt Expander works very well with the simple drag and drop action described above. This is also very helpful if your Web browser gives you a message saying that it does not know how to handle the file you are trying to download. In that message there is almost always a button selection that allows you to "Save the File" to your hard disk. Simply choose that button, and once the file is saved, drag and drop the file onto your StuffIt Expander icon or "Drag Window" window as described above. <br><br><br> <b>Q:</b> When I download a file from the Internet, StuffIt Expander sometimes fails to expand it. Either StuffIt Expander launches, then immediately quits as if nothing happened, or I get an error similar to one of the following: "Error -39 Unexpected End of File...", "This is not a complete file...", "This file is not in the right format..."<br><br><b>A: </b>There are several reasons you could be seeing this kind of behavior:<br><ul><li><b>Disk and Permissions Issues:</b><br> First and foremost, make sure your system is healthy. Disk errors and incorrect permissions can cause problems reading and writing files. As part of your regular periodic system maintenance, you should check your disk for errors and incorrect permissions. You can easily check for these issues using tools provided with OS X.</li><ol><br> <li>Boot up from your OS X install CD. (Insert the CD, reboot the machine and hold down the "C" key). At the first screen onf the installer, switch to the "Disk Utility" program using the menu command. Select your hard disk, then select the "First Aid" tab and click the "Repair Disk" button. When finished, if errors were found and repaired, repeat until the "Repair Disk" operation runs without reporting any errors. When finished, reboot from your hard disk.</li><br><li>When your machine has booted back up from the startup disk, launch the "Disk Utility" program located in the Utilites folder, in the Applications folder. Select your hard disk, then select the "First Aid" tab and click the "Repair Disk Permissions" button.</li></ol><br><li><b>Damaged or Incomplete Files:</b><br> When downloading a file from the Internet, it is possible that the file was damaged when posted, or damaged when downloaded. It is also possible that the download did not complete successfully.<br> <br>If possible, check the size of the original posted file in bytes (sometimes referred to as the "<b>byte count</b>") and compare that to the file you downloaded. If they do not match, then your downloaded file is probably incomplete or damaged. Try downloading the file again, perhaps choosing a different time of day or, if available, a different download site (or "mirror site"). Problems on the Internet tend to be intermittent and specific to certain regions of the Net itself. Before re-downloading you may want to try emptying you Web browser's cache to make sure you are getting a new copy of the file.<br> <br>  While the download is in progress do not use the computer for any other purpose as another application demanding too big a share of your processor's time might result in this sort of damage. </li><br><li><b>Internet Connection Problems:</b><br> If you are having frequent problems with downloaded files, it is a good idea to check with your ISP (Internet Service Provider) to see if they are aware of any outages or can test to see if there are problems with your connection or with traffic between them and the server you are trying to download from.<br> <br> If you are using a <b>dialup connection</b>, make sure that Call Waiting is disabled on the phone line your modem uses. If after repeated attempts at different times and/or from different sources you are still unable to download the file in question you might suspect phone line noise. To check for this plug a telephone into your modem line and make a call. Wiggle the phone and modem connections checking for noise or loose wires. If your connections are good but you still hear static on multiple days, you may want to contact your local telephone service provider, as they may be aware of issues in your area or able to test your line. (Tip: Many telephone service providers are more responsive to voice troubles than modem troubles so emphasize these if present.) <br> <br> Similar issues can be present when using <b>DSL or Cable Modems</b>. In the case of DSL, both the telephone company and the DSL Internet provider (not always the same company) may need to test for trouble. For Cable Modems, check with the Cable company for troubleshooting.</li><br><li><b>Incorrect Format:</b><br> If StuffIt Expander gives an message that says the file is not in the right format, this may indicate the file is damaged and it is worth trying the suggestions above. However, it may also mean the file was compressed, encrypted, or encoded in an unusual format that StuffIt Expander does not recognize. <br> <br> Look at the extension (the last few letters of the filename) and compare that to the <a href="EXPabout.html#FORMATS">list of formats</a> supported by Expander. If the extension is not in the list, see if you can find out what the format is. If you think it's a packaging format that StuffIt Expander should support, then <a href=http://www.allume.com/support/>let us know</a>...New formats and variations are being created all the time.</li><br><br><li><b>The file is already expanded:</b><br> The file may already be expanded but your machine may not have an application program that can open or edit the file. You may need to have information from the party that provided the file to know how to use it.  If you do not have the appropriate application you will need to obtain it by searching the web or a local software store.<br> <br> You can try double-clicking the expanded file.  If that doesn't help, you can try opening it by dragging and dropping onto the icons of applications that you do have installed. If you believe it is a picture, you could try dragging it onto your Web browser's icon or a picture viewer. If it's a word processed document, you could try your word processor's icon.<br> <br> For further help trying to open a file that has been expanded, please go to the "Using StuffIt Expander" area of this Help system and refer to the sections: <b>"<a href=EXPusing.html#CONTENTS>What's in the Package?</a>"</b> and <b>"<a href=EXPusing.html#TIPS>More Expander Hints and Tips</a>"</b>.</li></ul><br><br> <b>Q:</b> How can I stay informed of new developments with regard to the use of StuffIt Expander? <br><br><b>A: </b>  Subscribe to our RSS feeds or join our email lists.
