The archives you create can be expanded without StuffIt Expander, and they can also be used to display splash screen graphics and text-based Read Me files.<br>		<br>		<b>Overview</b><br>		<br>		StuffIt SEA Maker is an application that is used to create profiles, these profiles are then used to create self-extracting archives. The &quot;Archives&quot; created by the StuffIt SEA Maker application are not, in fact, really archives at all - in the strict sense of the word. Rather, the archives created by SEA Maker are Mac OS X application "packages". The SEA packages created with SEA Maker contain a StuffIt X archive, the application code necessary to expand that archive, along with instructions created from your profile about exactly how the files in the archive should be expanded. The SEA package also contains any text files and graphics you have chosen to include. Everything needed to expand the archive is contained within the package.<br>		<br>		In addition to creating self-extracting archives, StuffIt SEA Maker has a number of features that make it distinct from the other archives creation tools included with StuffIt Deluxe:</font>		<ul>			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"><b>Specify the location to which items are expanded:</b> StuffIt SEA Maker allows you to specify the location on your recipient's hard drive to which the items in the archive will be extracted. You can also choose to have the user be prompted to specify the location. SEA Maker allows you to add multiple sets of files to your archive, and each set of files can have a unique destination.</font>			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"><b>Display a Splash Screen:</b> SEA Maker allows you to add a Splash Screen to your archive. In fact, you can specify multiple images to be displayed at different times during the extraction process.</font>			<li><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"><b>Display a Text Message:</b> SEA Maker allows you to add a text dialog to your archive. As with the display of images, you can create an archive with multiple text dialogs that are displayed at different times during the extraction process.</font>		</ul>		<p><font size="2" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"><br>		<br>		<a href="../index.html">Back to Help Home Page</a><br>		<br>		</font><font face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial" size="1">Copyright &copy; 2007 Smith Micro Software, Inc.
