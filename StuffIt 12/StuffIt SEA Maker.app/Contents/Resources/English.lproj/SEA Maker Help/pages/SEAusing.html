The profile can be saved, for use at a later time, and you can also open and edit a profile at a later date. An SEA Maker profile can contain any number of phases. There are three types of phases that can be used:<br><br><b>Add Files and Folders to the SEA</b><br><br>The easiest way to add files to an SEA is to drag the items you want to archive from the Finder and drop them into the SEA Maker window. After you have dropped the files, you will see a new "Install Files" phase listed in the SEA Maker window.<br><br>By default, your recipient will be prompted to specify the location to which they want the files in the archive extracted when they run the SEA, but you can also specify an expand location while you are making the archive. Click the arrow in the "Destination" column to create a pop-up menu. You can either choose one of the default options on the list (such as Documents), or you can use the "Other..." option to specify a custom folder. If the folder you specify is not present on your recipients computer, they will be prompted to choose a new location.<br><br><b>Displaying an Image</b><br><br>To add a splash screen to your SEA, follow these steps:<ol>	<li>Click the "+" button in the SEA Maker window to create a new phase.</li>	<li>Choose "Display Image" from the menu that appears.</li>	<li>Use the navigation dialog that is created to browse for the image you want to display. SEA Maker supports a wide range of image formats. The rule of thumb is that if the image format is supported by QuickTime, it can be used with SEA Maker.</li></ol><b>Displaying a Text Dialog</b><ol>	<li>To add a text dialog to your SEA, follow these steps:</li>	<li>Click the "+" button in the SEA Maker window to create a new phase.</li>	<li>Choose "Display Text" from the menu that appears</li>	<li>Use the navigation dialog that is created to browse for the text file you want to use.<br><br>Note: The file must be formatted as a plain text document. Files in RTF format are not currently supported.</li></ol><b>The Info Tray</b><br><br>StuffIt SEA Maker includes a Preview Tray that allows you to view information about each of the phases described in your profile. <br><br><b>Saving your profile</b><br><br>Once you have set up your compression profile, you can save it for later use. To Save a the current profile, choose "Save" from the "File" menu.You can load a previously saved profile by choosing "Open" from the File menu.<br><br> <b>Building your SEA </b><br><br>Archives created by the StuffIt SEA Maker application are created as Mac OS X applications. You can create an SEA from SEA Maker by using the "Build" button in the toolbar. <br><br>If you plan to post your SEA on the Internet, we recommend that you save it onto a Disk Image. You can do this automatically by choosing the "Build Disk Image" button in the SEA Maker toolbar. When you choose this option, your SEA will be saved onto a DMG file that can be mounted as a disk in the Finder.<br><br>		<a href="../index.html">Back to Help Home Page</a><br><br><br><small>Copyright &copy; 2007 Smith Micro Software, Inc.
