Like the JPEG compression we introduced in 2005, these recompressors make files smaller by 'disassembling' the structure of the data type and compressing it more efficienly using the StuffIt X format's own compressors. When the item is expanded from the StuffIt X archive, the structure for that particular data type is reassembled. <br><br>Generally this results in output that is identical to the original, but in some instances the output may not be 100% identical. The content itself, and any ancillary data is never lost - just the bit encoding changes sometimes.<br><br>A good example is Zip recompression. There are many compression attributes that can be used to create a Zip archive. When recompressing a Zip into a SITx archive, the Zip is opened and its content is compressed into the SITx archive. Upon expansion, the Zip archive is recreated. The recreated Zip archive and the original Zip archive may have different compression attributes and are therefore not identical, but if each of the Zips is expanded the resulting output will be identical. This example also applies to image formats that contain compressed information as part of the structure. This is commonly referred to as "pixel-perfect". Identical output is commonly referred to as "bit-perfect". <br><br>StuffIt 12 includes custom recompressors for these file formats:<ul><li>JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg) - Always bit-perfect</li><li>JPEG lossless (.jls) - pixel-perfect</li><li>JPEG 2000 (.j2k) - pixel-perfect <br>    <b>Note - recompression is only applied when a j2k file is lossless encoded</b></li><li>Bitmap (.bmp) - Always bit-perfect</li><li>GIF (.gif) - pixel-perfect</li><li>TIFF (.tif, .tiff) - depends on data</li><li>PSD (.psd) - depends on data</li><li>PNG (.png) - pixel-perfect</li><li>PICT (.pict, .pct) - pixel-perfect</li><li>PXM (.pbm, .pgm, .ppm) - Always bit-perfect</li><li>MP3 (.mp3) - Always bit-perfect</li> <li>Zip (.zip, .cbz) - pixel-perfect</li><li>PDF (.pdf) - depends on data</li></ul><p>Check each type for which you wish to enable recompression. By default, the JPEG and Zip recompressors are enabled. The JPEG compressor has an additional option: Include Thumbnails. When this option is enabled, a small thumbnail of the image is stored in the archive for quick previewing.</p><a id="ZIP"></a><h3>Zip Preferences</h3>The following options effect how DropStuff creates Zip archives.<br><ul><li><b>Compression Level: </b>This control allows you to set the compression level used when DropStuff is creating Zip archives. You can choose "Better Compression", "Faster Compression" or "No Compression"; as the names suggest the Faster compression method makes archives more quickly, the Better compression method creates smaller archives, and the No Compression option just gathers the files together into a single archive file without compressing them. An additional choice, Custom is also available. When Custom is selected you can use the <a href="DSadvanced.html#ZIP">Zip Expert Compression Settings dialog</a> to determine how DropStuff will compress your files.</li><li><b>Encrypt Archives with a Passphrase: </b>When this option is checked, the archives you create will be encrypted with a passphrase. You will be prompted to provide a passphrase before the compression begins. When you create an archive with encryption, be sure to make a careful note of your passphrase. <b>Important! </b>Smith Micro cannot recover files from encrypted archives if you have lost your passphrase. Also note that passphrases are case-sensitive.</li><li><b>Preserve Macintosh Content: </b>This option determines whether or not Macintosh specific file attributes (such as a resource fork and Finder information) is preserved when adding files to Zip archives. Typically, if you are sending files to a Windows user you do not need to preserve this information, as it will not be used on a Windows-based computer. If you are sending files to a Macintosh user, we would recommend that you preserve Macintosh file information by sending your files in an archive format designed for the Macintosh, such as StuffIt X. <br><br><b>If you do need to send Macintosh files to other Macintosh users in Zip format, checking this option will preserve Macintosh file information in a way that is compatible with Apple's Zip implementation used in the Finder in Mac OS X 10.3 and later, but other options such as encryption may not be compatible with Apple's Zip implementation. Also note that Zip archives using Apple's method of preserving resource forks are not compatibile with pre-9.x versions of StuffIt Expander for Macintosh.</b><br><br> </li></ul><a id="TAR"></a><h3>TAR Preferences</h3> The following options effect how DropStuff creates TAR archives<ul>	<li><b>Compression Method: </b>By default, TAR archives are created without any form of compression. When you use DropStuff to create TAR archives you can specify that TAR archives be compressed after they have been created. You can choose to compress TAR archives using gzip (.gz), bzip2 (.bz2), and UNIX Compress (.Z).</li><li><b>Compression Level: </b>This control allows you to set the compression level used when DropStuff is compressing TAR archives. You can choose either "Better Compression" or "Faster Compression". An additional choice, Custom, is also available. When Custom is selected you can use the <a href="DSadvanced.html#TAR">TAR Expert Compression Settings dialog</a> to determine how DropStuff will compress your files.</li><li><b>Preserve Macintosh Content: </b>This option determines whether or not Macintosh-specific file attributes (such as resource forks and Finder information) is preserved when adding files to TAR archives. Typically, if you are sending files to a non-Macintosh user you do not have to preserve this information, as it cannot be used on a non-Macintosh based computer. If you are sending files to a Macintosh user, we would recommend that you preserve Macintosh file information by sending your files in an archive format designed for the Macintosh, such as StuffIt X.<br><br><b>Note that Tar archives using the AppleDouble encoding method of preserving resource forks are not compatibile with pre-9.x versions of StuffIt Expander for Macintosh.</b><br><br> </li></ul><h3>Destination Settings</h3> The destination page of DropStuff's preferences dialog contains settings that allow you to specify how each of DropStuff's available destinations work. Use the pop-up menu in the destination dialog to select the destination you want to use. Once you have selected a destination, additional options can be configured.<ul><li><b>Folder:</b> By default DropStuff is configured to save new archives to the same location in the Finder in which the archived items were located. If you stuff items on the Desktop, for example, the new archive will be created on the Desktop. You can also configure DropStuff to ask for a destination for each new archive, or you can configure a specific location to which will archives will always be saved.</li><li><b>CD/DVD:</b> When this option is selected, DropStuff will burn new archives to CD or DVD using the Finder's built-in burning software. The archives first need to be created on the disk before they can be burned, and the preferences dialog allows you to specify a temporary location to be used. This temporary archive is deleted from your hard drive once it has been successfully burned.</li><li><b>FTP:</b> DropStuff allows you to upload new archives to an FTP server. In order to use this feature, you must provide DropStuff with details about the FTP server you want to use. Specify the server, path, username and password in this dialog. The archive must first be created on your hard drive before it can be uploaded, and the FTP preferences allow you to specify the temporary location to be used. This temporary archive is deleted from your hard drive once the disk has been successfully uploaded.</li><li><b>.Mac:</b> DropStuff allows you to upload new archives to a .Mac iDisk. The archive must first be created on your hard drive before it can be uploaded, and the .Mac preferences allow you to specify the temporary location to be used. This temporary archive is deleted from your hard drive once it has been successfully uploaded. Archives will be uploaded to your Documents folder on your iDisk.</li></ul><h3>Encoding</h3> The options in the Encoding page allow you to instruct DropStuff to encode your archive for emailing after it has been created. You can choose to have DropStuff encode your archive using Binhex or UUencode. Use the "Simplify extension after encoding" option to remove the archive extension from the encoded file's name. Using this option on a file that would otherwise be created as "file.sit.hqx" will be named "file.hqx" instead.<h3>Options</h3> The settings in the Options page allow you to determine how DropStuff will behave when adding files to an archive.<ul><li><b>Ignore Special Finder Files: </b>When this option is set, DropStuff will not add Finder files (such as Desktop Database files or .DS_Store files) to an archive.</li><li><b>Create Individual Archives: </b>When this option is set, dragging multiple items to DropStuff will result in each item being compressed in its own individual archive.</li><li><b>Delete Originals: </b>When this option is set, DropStuff will delete the source file when creating an archive. <b>WARNING! - USE THIS FEATURE WITH CAUTION!</b></li></ul><a href="DSadvanced.html">See also Expert Compression Settings.</a> <br><br>		<a href="../index.html">Back to Help Home Page</a><br><br><br><small>Copyright &copy; 2007 Smith Micro Software, Inc.
