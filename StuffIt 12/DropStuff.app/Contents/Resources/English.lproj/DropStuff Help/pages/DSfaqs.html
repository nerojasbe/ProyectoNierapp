It's a process whereby information is "intelligently" discarded to create a smaller file. There is a sacrifice however. Generally, the discarded information has a negligible affect on the file's image, sound or playback quality, but the process can be modified so that there is greater compression but lower quality. Because StuffIt can be used to store critical information such as spreadsheet or database files, it uses <b>lossless compression</b>, a process where files are made smaller without discarding any information. When a file is compressed and then expanded it is identical (bit for bit) to the original file - no data is lost. <br><br><br><b>Q:</b> I am trying to compress files as small as possible. Any tips?<br><br><b>A:</b> Some files compress better than others. Compression algorithms look for redundancy in files. Many multimedia files are already saved in a "lossy" compression format which reduces this redundancy. You may get some further compression on certain "lossy" compressed files (such as .gif images or .mp3 audio files) by using the SITx recompression options.<br><br>To do this go to DropStuff's preferences.  In the <b>StuffIt</b> Preferences click on the <b>Recompression</b> tab. Check the boxes for each File Type that you are trying to compress.<br><br>Uncompressed multimedia formats such as .wav or .aiff (audio) and many high resolution graphics such as .psd (native PhotoShop picture), .eps (encapsulated postscript graphics), and uncompressed .tiff files will compress quite well. In fact, if you are starting out with a high resolution graphic you may get a smaller file with no loss of information by compressing into StuffIt X format instead of converting to a lossy format such as JPEG or GIF. <br> <br>To further optimize your compression settings, try adjusting the <a href="DSadvanced.html#SITX">Custom Compression Settings</a> to see if this improves your results.<br> <br><br><b>Q: </b>I have a password encrypted file for which I have forgotten the password. What can be done? <br><br><b>A:</b> There is nothing that we can do in this case: the contents of your file has been encrypted based on the password you provided, it cannot be decrypted without this password. There is no "backdoor", and we are not aware of any weakness that would allow you to break the encryption, short of trying all possible passwords. We apologize if this has caused you to lose an important file, but encryption would be a worthless feature if it could easily be bypassed. <br><br><br><b>Q: </b>Who can expand StuffIt X (.sitx) archives? <br><br><b>A: </b> Both Macintosh and Windows users can, provided they have a copy of our free expansion tool, StuffIt Expander. For the most backwards-compatible archive check the "Create Backwards Compatible Archives" option in DropStuff's StuffIt preferences.<a id="EXP"></a>The most current version of StuffIt Expander can be downloaded from: <a href="http://www.stuffit.com/expander">StuffIt.com</a><br><br><table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="0"><tr align="left" valign="top">	<td NOWRAP ><b><u><font size="1" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">OS Version</font></u></b></td>	<td><b><u><font size="1" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Recommended Expander Version</font></u></b></td></tr><tr align="left" valign="top">	<td NOWRAP ><b><font size="1" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Mac OS 8.6 - 9.2.2 (Classic Mac OS)</font></b></td>	<td><font size="1" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> - StuffIt Expander 7.0.3</font></td></tr><tr align="left" valign="top">	<td NOWRAP ><b><font size="1" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Mac OS 10.0 (Cheetah), 10.1 (Puma), 10.2 (Jaguar)</font></b></td>	<td><font size="1" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> - StuffIt Expander 8.0.2</font></td></tr><tr align="left" valign="top">	<td NOWRAP ><b><font size="1" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Mac OS 10.3 (Panther)</font></b></td>	<td><font size="1" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> - StuffIt Expander 10.0.2</font></td></tr><tr align="left" valign="top">	<td NOWRAP ><b><font size="1" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger)</font></b></td>	<td><font size="1" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> - StuffIt Expander 12.0</font></td></tr><tr align="left" valign="top">	<td NOWRAP ><b><font size="1" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Windows 98SE</font></b></td>	<td><font size="1" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> - StuffIt for Windows 9.0</font></td></tr><tr align="left" valign="top">	<td NOWRAP ><b><font size="1" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial">Windows 2000 or later</font></b></td>	<td><font size="1" face="Lucida Grande,Geneva,Arial"> - StuffIt for Windows 11.0.1</font></td></tr></table><br>Those users that cannot expand .sitx files for whatever reason should be sent StuffIt (.sit) archives which can be opened by StuffIt Expander 5.0 and later. We recommend StuffIt Expander 5.5 or higher for these archives. StuffIt Expander 5.5 works only on the Classic Mac OS versions, not on OS X. It and many other legacy versions of Aladdin/Allume/Smith Micro software, can be found in our software library archives. At the time of this writing the StuffIt Expander 5.5 can be found here:<br><br><a href=ftp://ftp.allume.com/pub/archive/mac/StuffIt_Expander/>ftp://ftp.allume.com/pub/archive/mac/StuffIt_Expander/</a><br><br>Once there, click on the file called: stuffit_expander_55.bin and the download will begin. If you have difficulties, there are some suggestions that should help posted here:<a href="http://www.stuffit.com/mac/expander/notes.html">StuffIt Expander download tips</a><br><br><b>Q: </b>What happened to DropZip, DropTar, and DropSegment?<br><br><b>A:</b> Starting with DropStuff version 9.0, DropStuff, DropTar, DropZip, and DropSegment have been combined together into a single drop box application, DropStuff. This allows more convenient access to features that were previously divided across multiple applications.<br><br>		<a href="../index.html">Back to Help Home Page</a><br><br><br><small>Copyright &copy; 2007 Smith Micro Software, Inc.
