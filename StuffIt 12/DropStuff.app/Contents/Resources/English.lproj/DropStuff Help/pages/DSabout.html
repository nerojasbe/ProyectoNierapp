Just as you use StuffIt Expander to open compressed and encoded files, you use DropStuff to create archives from your files and folders. DropStuff creates StuffIt X (.sitx), Zip (.zip), and TAR (.tar) archives.<br><br>Use DropStuff to compress the files you post on the internet, send as email attachments, or burn to CD, DVD, or save to other removable media to create backups. Whether you're storing backups of files on disks, or sending files over the Internet, using compression makes them smaller so that they will take less storage space, less time to upload, and less time to download. <br><br>While DropStuff can create, Zip and TAR archives, we highly recommend using the StuffIt X format. StuffIt X archives provide superior compression, and can compress your JPEG photos and images. StuffIt X includes important features that help you to protect your data; StuffIt X archives can be made with strong encryption, and can also be made with built in "error-correction" technology in many cases will allow StuffIt Expander to automatically repair damaged archives when it attempts to expand them. <br><br>Anyone can open StuffIt X archives using our StuffIt Expander software. Just point them to <a href="http://www.stuffit.com/expander">http://www.stuffit.com</a> to download the StuffIt Expander software they'll need. It's available for Macintosh (both Classic Mac OS and OS X), Windows and Linux/UNIX. And best of all, it's free! <h3>Register DropStuff</h3> If you are using StuffIt&reg; Standard Edition, the following features will be disabled when the initial 30-day trial period expires:<br><ul>	<li>Encryption</li>	<li>Segmentation</li>	<li>CD and DVD Burning</li>	<li>Uploading to FTP servers</li></ul>These features will be re-enabled when you purchase and register the software. <br><br>		<a href="../index.html">Back to Help Home Page</a><br><br><br><Small>Copyright &copy; 2007 Smith Micro Software, Inc.
